# Confluence API to create and edit pages with option to add images

## https://github.com/vdwstoffel/confluence_api

### This api can create a page and edit a page. It also has the option to upload images and display them on page. You need to get the page version and pass it into the function incremented by one to avoid crashed. The return automatiocally increments by 1

### You need to create your own templates for the page layouts. Will look to implement templates and the future and add more api's as needed
